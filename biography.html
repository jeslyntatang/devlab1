            <h1>About Jeslyn</h1>
            <p>I am a student at Balboa HIgh School and CodeNation. I value creativity, fairness, and history, 
            and hope to inspire a more positive world outlook in those I meet. I am interested in such art
            forms as drawing and storytelling, as well as language and global studies. I also believe in technology
            as a tool for helping society, as well as an opportunity for creative expression.</p>
